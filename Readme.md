# THIS IS EMIIIIIIII

## And I'm trying to understand stuff

I am a caffeinated wannabe web dev on a sugar rush!

***

### List of my most surprising skills: 
- lack of inspo 1
- lack of inspo 2
- maybe inspo will come 3

### Things I like most: 
- my little coffees 
- my little snacks
- sunshine 

### Objectives as a web dev: 
- land a job and change carreer
- making websites and stuff 
- challenge myself

### Fears 
- I've got too much to catch up to 
- Right now: git that doesn"t commit my stuff 
- no coffee or little snacks

### Things I'm looking forward: 
- This stuff to be commited
- And my little gif to actually be displayed instead of that ugly url 
- Next little snack

### Three things I value most as a team : 
- shared knowledge and help (thank you guys ;)
- motivation
- whoever made the coffee

### Favorite GIF:
